## Pre-Requisites to develop this app

	-  Spring Boot

	-  WhatsAPP Business Account (WATI)

## Development procedure

```

Note: WATI will review our template and they will approve it. Once template got approved then only we can send a msg using that template.

3) Configure WATI API Token & WATI Endpoint in our application

4) Use RestTemplate/Webclient to send msg to whatsapp using WATI API

1) Customer will fill registration form and will click on submit

2) Capture form data given by the customer 

3) Generate OTP using java method

4) Insert customer record in database table along with OTP generated by setting account status as "NOT_VERIFIED"

5) send OTP msg to customer given whatsapp number using wati api

			- prepare api request object
			- use wati api token
			- send post request with token + request object

6) After sending whatsapp msg, redirect customer to validate OTP page and ask customer to enter OTP

7) Customer will enter OTP and will submit the form for validation

8) Take form data and verify in our database table based on customer given email and otp. 

	With given details if record available that means it is valid otp then update account status as 'verified'
